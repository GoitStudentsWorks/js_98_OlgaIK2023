    <p class="text-discription">David Burroughs was once a devoted father to his three-year-old son Matthew, living a
        dream life just a short
        drive away
        from the working-class suburb where he and his wife, Cheryl, first fell in love--until one fateful night when
        David woke
        suddenly to discover Matthew had been murdered while David was asleep just down the hall.</p>
